# reactSample

As of 1/20/17,

This is a very simple note adding app that was built with React and Redux.  The home page displays the application's state.
It is still a work in progress, but I wanted to show that I understand and know how to implement React and Redux.

On the agenda for this repo...

    * figure out how to break apart objects and display object state on home page

    * possibly add some other feature that might be cool

    * testing

    * add spinner (or something like that) to ease the waiting during api calls
